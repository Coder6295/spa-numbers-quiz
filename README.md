## developers

### TODO

* apply CSS to all pages/scenes
* add redo/restart button
* (maybe?) add button _during_ quiz to end early
* on results page/scene, add icons for each of the numbers in the list of results; correct _and_ incorrect answers should get audio icons that say the number when clicked
